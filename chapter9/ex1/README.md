# Writing into a file
Write a program that prints the text "Hello world!" into the file "hello.usr". The file does not exist, so it must be created. Finally, the program must print a message on the screen indicating that writing to the file was successful. The text printed to the file must exactly match the assignment.

```
Writing to the file was successful.
Closing the program.
