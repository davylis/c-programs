# Table processing and pointers
The C program below receives integers as command line arguments. After receiving the required values, the program calls the subroutine "calculate_and_print" which receives an array and its size passed by the main program, prints the numbers on the screen and prints their sum on the screen.

Your task is to write the subroutine "calculate_and_print". The example printout shows how to print the numbers. The main program includes things that are outside the scope of this course, but you only need to write a subroutine that serves the main program.

example output:
```
Elements of the array: 43 53 654 65 77
Sum = 892
