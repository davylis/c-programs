# Handling matrices

The following is the initialisation of a 5 x 5 integer array:
```
int matrix[5][5] =
{
4, 6, 25, 88, 5,
34, 5, 300, 4, 65,
78, 43, 11, 90, 125,
98, 585, 12, 63, 21,
45, 35, 9, 5, 1
};
```
Copy the initialisation into a program that prints the array on the screen and calculates the sum of the elements. Each line shall be followed by a newline character.

```
Example output:
In the array:
4 6 25 88 5 
34 5 300 4 65 
78 43 11 90 125 
98 585 12 63 21 
45 35 9 5 1 


the sum of the elements is 1757
```
