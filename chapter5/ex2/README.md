Write a program that first asks the user whether they drink coffee or tea and then how many cups a day. Finally, the program prints a statement in accordance with the following instructions: Coffee 0 to 2 cups: "You don't drink a lot of coffee, do you?", coffee 3-20 cups: "You drink a lot of coffee!", Tea 0-2 cups: "You do not drink a lot of tea.", tea 3-20 cups: "You drink a lot of tea!", Otherwise "An error occurred in the program!" The number of cups shall be processed as an integer variable and the drink as a character variable (c/t). You do not need to account for upper case letters.
