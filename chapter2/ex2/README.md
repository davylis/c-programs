# Reading from the keyboard and printing
---
Write a program that prompts the user for an integer, calculates the square and prints the result on the screen (also print out a newline character \n after the result). After printing, the program closes itself.

```
Example output:
Enter an integer: 11
The square of the number you entered is 121
