#Processing strings
Write a program that prompts the user for a word (max 15 lower-case letters) and calculates the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u, y) in the word. Hint:
You have learned to compare the value of a character variable to 'a', for example. You can use an index to refer to single characters in a string array. (char[] = "word"; word[1] == 'a';)
```
The program calculates the number of vowels.
Enter a word:test
The word contains 1 vowels.
